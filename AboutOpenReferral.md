# Welcome

**The Open Referral initiative** is developing common formats and open platforms for the sharing of community resource directory data — i.e., information about the health, human and social services that are available to people in need.

This documentation describes the the Open Referral Initiative’s strategic framework. It is a living document! Please ask questions, offer suggestions, even propose additional sections!

## Vision

 

**The vision of Open Referral** is a world in which everyone has access to — and the ability to effectively use — information about the resources that are available in their community.

 

## Mission

**The mission of Open Referral** is three-fold:

**A)** **Develop 'open platforms'** (and associated tools) that accessibly, reliably, and sustainably circulate resource data among diverse stakeholders in a set of pilot localities.

**B)** **Develop a common data format** that enables interoperability across various technologies and institutional contexts, as informed by stakeholder feedback. 

**C)** **Foster a community of practice** dedicated to the pursuit of interoperable, reliable, accessible, and sustainable community resource data.

# Background

**Open Referral** was instigated by[ the DC Open211 ](http://communityresourcedata.codefordc.org/)[project](http://communityresourcedata.codefordc.org/), which is working to consolidate several siloed community resource directories into a shared, open platform.

The launch of Open Referral is co-sponsored by **Code for America** (CfA), in partnership with CfA's **[Ohan**a](http://ohanapi.org)[ project](http://ohanapi.org) (which received a 2013 grant from [the Knight Foundation’s Health Data Challenge](https://www.newschallenge.org/‎)). 

### DC Open211

The [DC Open211 project emerged](http://www.breadforthecity.org/2011/05/whats-social-service-directory-problem/) from conversations with **Bread for the City**, DC’s **Department of Human Services**, and other local institutions that produce or seek to use community resource directory data. Participants were interested in pooling the collective knowledge about services that was distributed in siloes among various service providers and other local organizations. From these conversations, a vision of a ‘DC Community Resource Platform’ emerged — in which various organizations could share the same data for use in various interfaces.

Upon release of the Ohana API, the DC Open211 project began consolidating community-produced directories into this open platform, while exploring long-term integration with their local and regional 2-1-1 systems.

### Code for America and Ohana

 

Code for America is a non-profit that collaborates with local governments to foster and facilitate innovation. Code for America focuses on the development of open source solutions that leverage the power of open data. Code for America’s fellowship program embeds technologists in local governments to address specific challenges.

 

In 2013, Code for America’s San Mateo fellows collaborated with **San Mateo County's Human Services Agency** to enhance the value of the county’s "Community Information Program." Previously, the Community Information Program’s database was only used to print a community resource directory. The San Mateo fellows developed an ‘Application Programming Interface’ (API) that enables this data to be accessed by an open set of applications. This API and associated software was named Ohana — Hawaiian for ‘family.’

 

In 2014, the Ohana project joined with the DC Open211 project to initiate Open Referral, along with representatives of the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems, Google, various providers of service referral products, and experts on interoperability of human service informatics. 

# FAQ

### What’s the problem? 

Every community faces a similar challenge: there are many different kinds of health, human, and social services that are available to people in need, yet no one way that information about them is produced and shared. Instead, many organizations collect and structure community resource directory data in different ways — yielding redundant, fragmented silos. 

As a result, it’s hard to ‘see’ the safety net. Many people never discover services that could help improve their lives. Service providers spend precious time verifying data rather than helping people. And without access to this information, decision-makers struggle to evaluate community health and program effectiveness. This yields underperforming systems that fail people and communities in tragic ways. 

### What’s the opportunity?

Among various movements towards open platforms and data standards in the civic technology space, a tremendous opportunity recently emerged when Schema.org proposed a ‘civic services’ schema to the W3C. This schema represents a new standard that can enable community resource data to be parsed and provided by search engines like Google, etc. 

With this, we have a mandate to bring governments, funders, civic institutions, and technologists together around a shared goal: establish the means for interoperability between the language of the web and the field of information and referral systems, and discover new means to sustain the production of service directory data as an open resource.

### What do we mean by ‘standards’? 

By standards, we refer to common ways of doing things. In the case of data standards, that means an agreed-upon set of terms and relationships that structure information. 

By developing standards, we can make it easier for new technologies to develop, spread, and scale. When a system is proven to be effective, standards enable it to be shared elsewhere. This lowers the barrier to entry for new participants (who no longer have to develop systems from scratch). Standardizing data across places and institutions also allows for a whole new kind of analysis and contextualization, through which people can see how a given community or program compares to others. 

Furthermore, the process of developing standards helps to bring stakeholders together. By building a community among users, producers, and service providers, we can accelerate the process of learning and innovation towards our shared vision of helping people and improving the health of communities.

### What do we mean by Open Data?

**_'Open data' is a popular term right now. It’s also ambiguous. _****_What does it mean?_**

 

**Open indicates availability.** We have "open access" to things like roads and libraries -- these are public goods, and anyone should be able to use them.

**Open means 'free,' as in 'free speech'**: we are all entitled to it by fundamental right.

 

**Open does not necessarily mean 'anything goes.'** You’ve gotta return books to the library, and in good condition too. Even on open roads, there are speed limits, and eventually there are tolls, plus construction and cleanup crews, etc. 

  

**Open does not necessarily mean 'free' as in ****_without cost_****.** For something to exist in an open state, a lot of energy and resources must go into keeping it so. 

 

 

**_Open data can mean many things, but at its core, open data entails:_**

**Access**: open data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, presumably downloadable over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.

**Reuse and Redistribution**: the data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution, including the intermixing with other datasets. There should be no discrimination against fields of endeavor or against persons or groups. The data must be[ machine-readable](http://okfn.org/opendata/glossary/). The data can be licensed to prevent changes and/or to ensure clear documentation of changes.


**Openness entails a state of possibility.**

 

By making data available for anyone to use it, we can dramatically broaden the scope of its potential value. We assert as a given that the production of open referral data can, will, and should happen. But we also assume that such value can (even must) be realized in such a way that the cost of its reliable reproduction is sustainably carried into the future, in order for this data to effectively meet our collective needs.

 

For the purposes of Open Referral, the concept of 'open data' is itself open to some degree of interpretation. Essentially, we are asking: how *should *this data be open? If it is to be published in bulk for free, can premium real-time access via API require a fee? If the market won’t fully cover costs of its production in this way, should the government be expected to subsidize its production, in order to ensure access and quality? Etc.

### What do we mean by Referral?

  

Broadly speaking, people seek 'referrals' to **_resources_** that can help them meet their needs. Community resource data connects people to **_health, human, and social services_** from which they can receive assistance. 

 

Some such services are provided by non-profit organizations and other civic or cultural groups. Others are provided by city, state, even federal governments. All of these entities share information about their resources in different ways.

 

By developing standards for the collection and sharing of such data, we can reach common agreement on concepts like **meaning**,** structure **and** transfer**. With such common agreements, it can become ever easier to leverage existing resources and technology, and to develop new technologies at lower cost and broader possible use.

 

Through Open Referral, we are exploring ways to establish standards for the production and circulation of information about such resources, and to support the development of 'open platforms' that make this data commonly available.

 

### Aren't there already standards for referral information?

There are existing standards among similar systems, but these are not designed for the transfer of information among *any* system. Indeed, the work of developing a 'universal data exchange standard' does not entail starting from scratch, so much as calibrating alignment with that which already exists. For the first phase of Open Referral, we have identified a core set of existing standards with which our standards aim to be *interoperable*. Specifically, these include: 

 

•           Alliance of Information and Referral Systems' [XSD](http://www.airs.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3363‎) and [the AIRS/2-1-1 Taxonomy](http://www.211taxonomy.org)

•           The [W3C's civic services schema](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices), proposed to [the W3C](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebSchemas/CivicServices) through [Schema.org](http://blog.schema.org/2013/08/vocabulary-for-describing-civic-services.html)

•           The [National Human Services Information Architecture](https://raw.github.com/hserv/open-human-services/master/doc/NHSIA_conceptual_data_model.jpeg) (NHSIA) which is [based upon](http://www.acf.hhs.gov/nhsia-definition) the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)

Open Referral's stack of standards (which will, at the very least, include specifications for structuring, sorting, and circulating data) will demonstrate interoperability with these standards. (This may also entail proposing the expansion of, or even advocating for changes to, these standards.)

### What benefits can we anticipate?

Through adoption of standards and open data, resources can shift from production towards innovation in *use *of the data. 2-1-1s and other I&Rs can establish themselves as *validators* of open data, and/or focus more energy on *value-added delivery *of data. Likewise, vendors could focus more on product (sharing generated value with the validating source of data). Finally, government and funders benefit from cost-savings and also gain access to standardized data for program evaluation and decision-making.

# Documentation

We already have the basic components of an ‘open stack’ for structuring and sharing community resource directory data.

# Types of use - Personas

Our work is specifically for the benefit of users (see “[our principles](#principles)”) and we ground this work by identifying the different *types of use* that are relevant to this domain. These are the different perspectives from which we assess, design, and evaluate the products of this initiative. (In other words, when we talk about “[our values](#values),” we talk about them in these contexts.) We’ve identified four broad types (each of which includes many subtypes). **[Read more here for full personas and user stories**.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqueBVbRVgR0BVGjDbUdN4suUYfMKm7yJm1f3nRsGtY/edit#)

**Seeking Help **

*i.e. help seeker, clients, patients, end-users, consumers  *

Help seekers have some pressing need (or more likely, multiple needs) which might be addressed by services in their community. To realize this possibility, help seekers must receive accurate, relevant, and easily understandable information about services which they can access and for which they are eligible.

**Providing help **

*i.e. referrers, service providers, case managers, social workers, librarians, call operators, etc*

A ‘referrer’ is usually (but not always) a professional or a volunteer who is working for some organization that itself provides a service to its community. Referrers are typically the primary users of resource directory information systems. Referrers want to trust the information they provide to help-seekers — trust regarding a) the information’s accuracy, b) the service’s relevance (is the client eligible), and c) the quality of the service. 

**Administering data **

*i.e. resource specialist, database manager, IT staff, the intern who produces a directory, etc*

Data administrators is typically an "internally facing" role, involving someone who has responsibility of some kind for an information system. This refers to the work done by system administrators, data producers, vendors, volunteer civic technologists, people who compile directories of all kinds. Data admin are responsible for information production and maintenance — such as updating records, maintaining naming conventions, running reports, designing mechanisms for retrieval and delivery, etc. Generally, they want more people to be able to make better use of the data that they are administering.

**Research and Analysis**

*i.e. researcher, analyst, wonk, community planner, community leader, decision-maker, etc*

This type includes anyone who wants to use service directory data, in synthesis with other kinds of data, for the purpose of understanding community health, predicting future needs, identifying funding gaps, and other kinds of analysis. Such a role is often played by funders, policymakers, planners, or community leaders. Researchers are seeking accountability for the performance of the health, human, and social service system overall. They want their work to make this data useful for system-level decision-making.

# Architecture of Participation: Summary (NOTE:  Full Architecture of Participation document, including profiles of each type of participant, is here.)

The community resource data problem is complex. It involves private and public sectors. It spans local, state, federal, and even international boundaries. The very nature of the problem is in a state of accelerating change (as institutions complexify and technology yields new possibilities and new complications). This means our search for solutions should be complex. 

This Initiative is designed to be **_iterative_**; **_federated_** across various layers of decision-making processes (particularly **_global and local_**, but also regional and sector-based); and **_structurally accountable_** at each level to organized and informed users. Specifically, this entails** ****_‘core’ coordination_** capacity, **_a global network_** with* ***_a designated workgroup_**, **_local pilots_** with their own **_leadership tables_**, and recurring **_workshops_** where all convene.

**_Core coordinating team_****_ creating space and helping pieces move together._**

At a bare minimum, the Open Referral initiative requires two dedicated people in global coordinating capacity — both technical and institutional leadership. (Future cycles should also include operational capacity.) Likewise, the ‘core’ should also include leads for each pilot project (at least one, ideally two people). Responsibilities are facilitative.

**_Local pilots_****_ implementing data exchanges, evaluating model, planning for future._**

Local pilot projects should consist of teams, anchored by **_lead_**** ****_stakeholders_** (i.e. organizations that regularly need directory data to serve their communities, and who step up to work toward solutions). These stakeholders will be represented by a **_leadership structure_** (a ‘table’ or ‘committee,’ etc). They are joined by **_partners_** (i.e. funders, civic technology networks, vendors) who may be essential in implementation, if not decision-making. 

**_Global network_****_ of practitioners, experts, vendors, and grassroots leaders._**

Open to all participants who share the vision and values, the Open Referral network is primarily assembled in our Google group, and other channels (blog, email list, etc).

**_Workgroup_****_ of designated leads advising design, implementation and governance_**

The Workgroup should consist of domain specialists who agree to advise on the development of the common data model, its implementation and evaluation, and the governance of Open Referral overall. Currently, those members are nominated by the community and invited by the core coordinators; the Workgroup itself is empowered to propose changes to this and other aspects of the Initiative.

**_Workshops_****_ on regular basis to bring it all together_**

Global and local leadership convene regularly at Workshops, to share, learn, deliberate.

## Work Group 

[See [this memo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pB6QxbFSNGKDKmcpJ79ZHCkLL6UR_TsZhBraYUEyOzU/edit#) for more details]

### Structure

Work Group participants are nominated by or recruited from the Open Referral network,  based upon particular skill sets and experiences, with priority granted to representatives from pilot projects and from relevant standard-bearing institutions (such as AIRS and Schema.org). The work group is facilitated by two Open Referral leadership positions: **the lead developer** and **the lead coordinator**. [Conversations from the Work Group are publicly visible here. ](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openreferral-workgroup)

### Scope

The Working Group will address the following, in iterative phases:

**CONCEPTUAL DESIGN**: Articulating user stories and identifying their functional attributes 

**TECHNICAL DESIGN: **producing technical artifacts and associated format specifications, based on conceptual design and linked to existing vocabularies currently in usage.

**IMPLEMENTATION/EVALUATION:** documentation to guide local pilot projects in implementing the model and associated tools, testing and evaluating their effectiveness.

**GOVERNANCE/SUSTAINABILITY:** deliberation on short-term decision-making and research/proposal for long-term stewardship of the model

**Delivering the following outputs: **

* A schema for structuring service directory data (i.e. [Open Referral Github repo](http://github.com/codeforamerica/openreferral) - [Google Doc of v0.2 specification here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RH89UY7FDndivWNmtQkql4tdRTwYnCZluyu8itp5nTw/edit?usp=sharing))

    * Documented compatibility with the following existing standards:

        * AIRS/211 (XSD and taxonomy)

        * National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) and the NIEM-based National Human Services Information Architecture[ ](http://schema.org/W3C)(NHSIA)

        * [Schema.org/W3C](http://schema.org/W3C) civic services schema

* Protocols for circulating this information on the web (i.e. [Ohana API](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/))

* Documentation to guide Implementation and evaluation for local pilot projects

* Proposals for governance and sustainability of the Open Referral initiative

# Work shops:

# The Open Referral initiative will periodically convene in Workshops, during the peak of each development cycle, after a period of testing and evaluation by pilot projects. Workshops will be hosted in a rotating set of pilot project communities. Workshops are not necessarily decision-making events, but are critical opportunities for sharing knowledge, building relationships, and setting the agenda for future development. Workshops will include members of the Work Group and the stakeholders from the hosting pilot project. These events will generate and prioritize ‘user stories’ and possible courses of action to meet the needs expressed by those user stories. [[See this reportback from the inaugural workshop.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kivG6TTw1LKhJRAQHeqH7fTIxZZaDojXRRBYEd_ltWw/edit#)]

## Local Teams

*[**[See One Pager here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZDJ0ZcdbU_rEN02A2RWfw0fmMiSpKX9giK7zjf5lCo/edit#heading=h.v7dibkmbajlo)**]

Open Referral is led by **local pilot projects** in which stakeholders take action towards establishing accessible, interoperable and reliable community resource directory data**.**  Pilots commit to using the Open Referral data model — and in return, their feedback is prioritized in shaping the iteration of that model. The goals of pilot projects include demonstrating short-term value and developing the means for long-term sustainability.

### Participants:

Local pilot projects consist of teams led by **_community stakeholders_** — i.e. organizations that regularly need service directory data to serve their communities, including front-line service organizations (such as libraries, schools, hospitals, homeless shelters, etc) as well as referral services, safety net funders, research institutions, local governments, etc. **_Lead stakeholders _**commit time and resources to lead the way to find solutions. 

Stakeholders are joined by **_partners_** (i.e. civic technology networks, software vendors) who may be essential in implementation, though not ultimately in decision-making capacity.

### Leadership: 

We encourage a pilot project to have some sort of** leadership structure **(a ‘table’ or ‘committee’) comprised of representatives of lead stakeholders who meet regularly to deliberate and decide upon issues of sustainability and governance. We expect that standing coordinating capacity (presumably a full-time organizer, ideally with contracted technical support) will be required to best leverage these commitments into action.

### Objectives:

Local teams have four distinct objectives. 

* **Data** aggregated, standardized, and validated according to the Open Referral model

* **Platforms** that circulate data to and from an open ecosystem of apps and tools.

* **Testing and evaluation** of data, platforms, and applications through user groups.

* **Planning** for long-term sustainability and governance.

### Criteria for success:

* Improved data quality.

* Cost savings. 

* Improved service outcomes. 

* Meaningful use in research.

### Costs:

We estimate that each local pilot project will require $60k-125k in funding per year, for at least two years. This includes funding for at least one and up to two full-time staff (primarily, community organizing capacity; ideally, part- or full-time technical capacity), programming (including a major workshop) and, ideally, stipends for lead stakeholder participation.

# Values and Principles

The following is a set of **values** (*the reasons why we are doing this work*) and **principles** (*the ways we agree to work, rooted in those values*) that define the Open Referral Initiative. Taken as a whole, these draw clear lines around what it means to be a part of this community; guidelines for decision-making; a rubric for evaluation; the basis of norms and rules; etc. 

## <a id=“values”></a>Values

These are the reasons why the Open Referral Initiative exists. These words may mean different things in different contexts, and at times there might even be tension between these values; this isn’t meant to prescribe courses of action so much as provide a framework to guide thinking and deliberation. The common theme of "abilities," as in our stakeholders’ abilities to effectively meet their needs.

* **Accessibility**

* **Interoperability**

* **Reliability**

* **Sustainability**

## <a id=“principles”></a>Principles

*The Open Referral community is open to all who wish to work towards a future of **open, interoperable, reliable, and sustainable community resource directory data** — and who share a few simple principles:  *

**Open source.** All of the products produced through the Open Referral initiative will be Free / Libre / Open Source. Open Referral recognizes the right for any members to adapt this technology as they see fit, though we assert the prerogative of compliance with standards (and we also acknowledge the ‘right to fork’). This rule extends to the process itself — transparency is essential to our work. We will have designated decision-makers, but all the processes leading up to the decision will be posted in public, and the labor and reasoning that go into production will be tracked for review. (In other words: log your time, and take/post minutes!)

**User prerogatives.** Our first and most important question is 'what's in the interests of users?’ Specifically, our stakeholders are (in roughly descending order of importance) 1) ‘help seekers’ (people seeking help), 2) service providers (people who make referrals to others), 3) ‘analysts’ (people conducting research to understand the health of communities), 4) ‘database administrators’ (technologists working with the data). Other agents in our community (such as software vendors and institutions not engaged in direct service) are encouraged to participate under the assumption that their interests are ultimately best served by attending to the interests of the users above.

**Test assumptions.** Technology is rapidly changing our world. Conventional ways of doing things may have been shaped by conditions that are no longer necessary or true. Yet new ways of doing things are often unproven. The surest way to sort strategy from folly is to make explicit the assumptions undergirding each — and test them. Ultimately, our mission is to produce learning, even more than code and data.

**Be kind.** You don't have to be nice but you do have to be kind. There's a line. It usually has to do with conflating a person and a problem. We'll know it when we see it, and we will call it out and not tolerate repeat offenses. This rule entails not just personal kindness, but also kindness to the community: if you are drawing attention to a problem, you should be ready to work toward a solution. Another way of understanding this rule is: we assume that everyone is acting in good faith and therefore deserves respect. If evidence mounts to the contrary, we reserve the right to exclude parties from the forum and associated activities. 

## Assumptions 

These are a set of stated assumptions that gird this initiative. We will test them.  

* It is possible to establish interoperability between AIRS / 2-1-1 standards (both schema and taxonomy) and new standards such as the W3C civic services schema.

* Adoption of open data standards is a necessary step towards making community resource directory data freely accessible and reliable for the many ways in which it’s needed. 

* Standards will also help spur innovation, lower the cost of development, and bolster a community of practice in this field.

* The production of open community resource directory data can be sustainable.

* Communities already have most if not all of the resources that they need to sustainably produce reliable open data. However, these resources are currently trapped in silos, and it will require both technological development and social facilitation to break down those silos.

* The cost of maintaining up-to-date resource data can be lowered by opening systems to receive input from users.

* The cost of data maintenance will not drop to zero; some designated steward of the data will remain necessary to ensure reliability and accountability. 

* Local stakeholders can play a leading role in researching, proposing, and implementing plans to achieve that sustainability.

## **Hypotheses:** 

*Hypothesis:*

We can develop a web-based exchange format that is **broadly applicable** (covers most of the critical information in most of the cases) and **lightweight** (easy to use) and **interoperable **with the AIRS XSD and the W3C civic services schema.

*Hypothesis:*

If we adopt a standard format for describing a common core set of directory data, the **cost of developing and re-deploying new tools and websites will drop**, and **the number and quality of such tools and sites will increase**.

*Hypothesis:*

"Open data systems" can **increase distributed usage**, which will yield an **increase in user-submitted feedback on data quality**, which will yield **a decrease in the cost of maintaining data quality**.

*Hypothesis:*

If an I&R system becomes the ‘open hub’ of a referral ecosystem,** it can the distributed use of its resource data**, and that metadata can be made available in exchange for revenue from funders, researchers, and governments. 

*Hypothesis:*

Through open platforms (publishing open data via API and other methods) we can establish **new sources of revenue **through negotiated agreements with vendors and other institutions that will **pay for value-added services that use the data**.
